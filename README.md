# c Programming
My journey into C programming — notes, exercises, and projects to build a strong foundation for Embedded Systems, Robotics, and Computer Vision.
# 🖥️ C Programming Repository

This is my personal journey in learning and mastering **C programming**.  
The repo will serve as a collection of notes, practice exercises, and projects that I will keep updating over time.

## 📌 About
C is the foundation of many areas I’m interested in:
- **Embedded Systems**
- **Robotics**
- **Computer Vision**
- **Signals and Systems**

By mastering C, I’ll build the skills to understand microcontrollers, memory management, and low-level programming.

## 📂 Planned Structure
- **basics/** → Hello World, variables, loops, conditionals.  
- **functions/** → Modular programming, recursion.  
- **arrays_pointers/** → Arrays, strings, and pointers.  
- **file_processing/** → Reading/writing files in C.  
- **data_structures/** → Linked lists, stacks, queues, trees.  
- **mini_projects/** → Small projects to apply what I’ve learned.

## 🚀 My Goal
- Build a **strong foundation in C programming**.  
- Use this knowledge to move into **C++**, Embedded Systems, and IoT.  
- Document my journey and create a resource I can look back on.
